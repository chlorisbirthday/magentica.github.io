                Oceanus is a project to remove the garbage from the sea. 
                     After sending the devices to the garbage-populated area which is obtained from the data analysis, 
                the devices retrieve the trash and transport them to the land, potentially recycling it.</font></p>

                     Once the system is established at the spot we’ve found from the data, the ocean waste will be caught by the mesh. Fish will never be caught into it, because an electric pulse will be always generated by the energy from the solar-energy generator.
                     When the trash accumulates(appropriate load: 400 ton), the elevating lift operates(by solar energy), the gathering machine comes up to the top of the mesh and sweeps the trash from the mesh while ascending.
                     After that, the trash returns to the land where it belongs to. We designed the body of the gathering module in a spiral form so that the process of collecting wastes or transporting may happen more effectively.
                The waste are mostly used for other economic activities, and the rest of the plastic waste are reproduced for new systems(transporting machines, gathering modules).<br>

                     One of the potential risks of laying the skirt of nets and collect floating garbage is that lots of fish could be caught.
                     Because we are arranging the system in the region where lots of marine life live in, we had to be contemplated in displacing our system without harming those natural life.
                     As a solution, we have come up with the fish repelling device via electric pulse. First developed by Smith-Root, a fish repelling system called Fish Guidance and Deterrence Barriers contains BP-1.5 Programmable Output Waveform pulsars.
                     The pulsars are connected to a group of electrodes submerged in the waterway. Pulsars store energy inside them and discharges it.
                     Since pulse width and repetition are adjustable to create the waveform required to halt the movement of fish, it makes fish to avoid the waterway without harming the fish.
                     Based on this model, we attach the pulsars at the top of the aluminum mesh so that the mesh can widely spreads out the pulse to nearby area, leading fish to avoid the mesh.
                     Considering the wide size of mesh, various pulsars are needed. However, since aluminum has high conductivity, efficiency would be high enough.
                     Sufficient amount of energy can be provided from solar panel which is placed upon the floating module.

                     The Ocean Cleanup Project has measured the vertical distribution of plastic oceanic garbage during their 6 expeditions from 2013 to 2015.
                     According to their results, buoyant plastic garbages such as PET bottle are distributed within the top 5 meters of the ocean.
                     We referred to this data, and set the depth of our aluminium mesh and the location of gathering module to be 5 meters below the surface.
                     Floating module and the aluminium mesh attached to it has a wire for the gathering model to arise.
                     It uses electricity created from solar panels on the top of the floating module to operate.

               We set the top radius into 10m, and the bottom radius into 9m. This is because the gathering module needs to gather as many wastes as possible, and also it has to maintain its center of mass so that the whole system doesn’t just cave over.
               By using the density of the material of gathering module(UHMW-PE), we calculated the total mass of it. It is about 106 ton.
               Once we calculated the total mass, we approximatelly calculated the appropriate load by simulating the whole system using the program “Maya 3D”. We set the standard for the maximum weight that can maintain the whole system(not just flip over).

                   We chose one point from various coordinates where ocean current is accumulated a lot, which has a longitude of 155 and latitude of 10 to apply drag equation to calculate the threshold force to set the floating module stationary. For the gathering module which is set below water, we have modeled the magnitude of drag force and the magnitude of countering force against drag force. According to our modeling, total countering force in need is 0.346(N). Because it is small enough to neglect compared to its total weight of 106t, gathering module does not need power module to be pushed forward. For the floating module we have modeled the condition with the method applied in the case of gathering module. Because the floating module has 223t of total weight, it is accelerated by a rate of 1.097 (m/s^2). This amount of electric power is provided by solar panels on the floating module. Since total amount of energy produced from the solar panel exceeds the threshold for the floating module to stay stationary, the whole device can maintain mechanical equilibrium, without either being swept away by ocean current/wind or being capsized.
